# Guide to Interview Prep Materials
----
Welcome to the UMUC-CS Guide to Interview Prep Material. Here you will find useful links to various preparation materials and site. 

If you have any additional books or links you'd like to add please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details on how to submite them.

## Interview Prep Books

The foundation for most technical interview preparation these days is still the good old fashion book. Below you will find the most common books, with a brief description.

### [Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7CD3BJZ761GXYNGMMRQ5)

Probably the most referenced and referred to book when discussing technical interview preparation. It cover the interview process, a brief primer on each data structure and algorithm type, as well as 189 example questions. The examples and solutions are written java.

**Topics Covered:** Big O, Arrays and Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Trees and Graphs, Bit Manipulation, Math and Logic Puzzles, Object-Oriented Design, Recursion and Dynamic Programming, System Design and Scalability, Sorting and Searching, Testing.

### [Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI) - Java](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=3EJWVCMJWTFCZJ170WZF)

Another great book. This one is a little more technical than CTCI. It also covers the interview process and provides bootcamps on common data structures and algorithms. This books is also offered with examples and sample problems in Python and C++:

* [Elements of Programming Interviews - Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=65M0GZF961KX8Z5SER3T)
* [Elements of Programming Interviews - C++](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=56C3BJ5CTYGXFYVC4J3Y)

**Topics Covered: ** Primitive Types, Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Binary Trees, Heaps, Searching, Hash Tables, Sorting, Binary Search Trees, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms and Invariants, Graphs, Parallel Computing 

## Algorithm Books
---
Need to brush up on your data structures and algorithms? Sometimes a book is just what you need.

### [Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=pd_sim_14_8?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=DZSEDRD0W88XMQ32FQQ9)
One of the seminal algorithm books. It assumes exposure to Discrete Math and undergraduate statistics. All of the examples are language agnostic (i.e. written in pseudocode).

### [Algorithms (Sedgewick)](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/ref=pd_cp_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=6JFBFWNS6RFG85VGWZZP)
Another seminal work. Examples are written in Java, however some critique that the verbosity of Java syntax can sometimes be distracting, however, the language is overall more conversational than CLRS.
